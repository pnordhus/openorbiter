                                 OpenOrbiter
                                 ===========


1. About OpenOrbiter

The first version of OpenOrbiter was written in 2004, inspired by the Mac OS
game "Orbituary". Since then it has evolved into a platform independent
Qt application with an easy to use interface.


2. How to play

This is pretty straight forward: Each player uses a single key to control
an Orbiter on a 2-dimensional map. Pressing the key attaches or detaches the
Orbiter to or from the nearest Node. While linked to a Node the Orbiter moves
around it on a circle, gaining speed. While not linked, the Orbiter is affected
by gravity, so it basically falls.


3. Installation

To compile and install OpenOrbiter simply do the following:

qmake
make install

If you want to install to a location different from /usr/local do:

qmake PREFIX=/destination/dir
make install
